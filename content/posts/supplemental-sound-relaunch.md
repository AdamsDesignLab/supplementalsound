# Supplemental Sound: A Fresh Start

_Published on February 14, 2025_

## Why the Change?

I’ve moved Supplemental Sound away from Substack. It was time for a simpler, less intrusive platform—one that offers complete control over what goes on the page. I decided to archive all old content and begin anew. This clean slate aligns with my focus on clarity, local engagement, and direct delivery of music-related insights.

## Hosting and Customization

Even though the technical details aren’t critical to readers, I’m now using a more customizable approach that spares everyone from spammy emails and clutter. The site is streamlined, faster, and under my control. No more unnecessary features or distracting elements.

## A Note on Valentine’s Day

It’s Valentine’s Day, and I feel genuine appreciation for the local music community. There’s a shared passion that makes exploring upcoming concerts and new tracks worthwhile. The goal here is straightforward: connect with fellow music enthusiasts through concise posts and relevant updates, free from friction and fluff.

## What to Expect Going Forward

- **Concert Highlights:** Regular coverage of local shows, including dates, venues, and why they matter.
- **Music Commentary:** Brief reflections on the tracks and albums I listen to, focusing on what stands out—no filler or pandering.
- **Community Connections:** Opportunities to spotlight independent artists, venues, and regional events that deserve attention.
- **No Archives:** Everything starts here. Old posts are off the table, which means less noise and more current updates that fit my new direction.

## Upcoming Posts

Check back for upcoming concert picks, quick-hit reviews of albums I’m spinning, and deeper dives into local music culture. If you’re looking to keep up with essential music happenings, this is where I’ll lay it all out.
