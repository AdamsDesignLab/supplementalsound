        <h2>Supplemental Sound: A Fresh Start</h2>
        <p><em>Published on February 14, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>Why the Change?</h2>
        <p>I’ve moved Supplemental Sound away from Substack. It was time for a simpler, less intrusive platform—one that
            offers complete control over what goes on the page. I decided to archive all old content and begin anew.
            This clean slate aligns with my focus on clarity, local engagement, and direct delivery of music-related
            insights.</p>

        <h2>Hosting and Customization</h2>
        <p>Even though the technical details aren’t critical to readers, I’m now using a more customizable approach that
            spares everyone from spammy emails and clutter. The site is streamlined, faster, and under my control. No
            more unnecessary features or distracting elements.</p>

        <h2>A Note on Valentine’s Day</h2>
        <p>It’s Valentine’s Day, and I feel genuine appreciation for the local music community. There’s a shared passion
            that makes exploring upcoming concerts and new tracks worthwhile. The goal here is straightforward: connect
            with fellow music enthusiasts through concise posts and relevant updates, free from friction and fluff.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect Going Forward</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concert Highlights:</strong> Regular coverage of local shows, including dates, venues, and why
                they matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Music Commentary:</strong> Brief reflections on the tracks and albums I listen to, focusing on
                what stands out—no filler or pandering.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Connections:</strong> Opportunities to spotlight independent artists, venues, and
                regional events that deserve attention.</li>
            <li><strong>No Archives:</strong> Everything starts here. Old posts are off the table, which means less
                noise and more current updates that fit my new direction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Upcoming Posts</h2>
        <p>Check back for upcoming concert picks, quick-hit reviews of albums I’m spinning, and deeper dives into local
            music culture. If you’re looking to keep up with essential music happenings, this is where I’ll lay it all
            out.</p>
